syslog-summary (1.15) UNRELEASED

  * Fix Makefile so that it creates the needed directories before
    actually trying to install anything in them.
  * Don't hardcode python2.5 in the source

 -- David Paleino <d.paleino@gmail.com>  #DATE#

  * Added ability to provide additional date patterns. By default, regular
    expressions are read from file /etc/syslog-summary/dates.rules. Custom
    rule file may be specified via --dates=<file> option.
